# Sample NodeJS Project

This is a personal project I create in order to play around with different [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/) modules and some other tools.

The initial version was based on the [this](https://www.codejobs.biz/es/blog/2014/09/09/aprendiendo-nodejs-creacion-de-sistema-de-traducciones-i18n) tutorial and more stuff will be added following different tutorials(I will add the reference to these tutorials on the references file) and using some other stuff I already know.

Any suggestion or improvement is welcome :)
